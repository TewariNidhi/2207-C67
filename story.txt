Once upon a time, there were a hare and a tortoise.
They both had different personalities, but they were good friends.
One sunny day as they strolled through the forest, the hare couldn't help but brag about his extraordinary abilities.
The tortoise, wise and humble, smiled and replied "Well my dear friend, speed is impressive but determination is equally important."
